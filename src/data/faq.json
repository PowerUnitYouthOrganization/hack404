For our regular stream, you'll have the full 36 hours to work on a project, with exciting workshops, activities, and mentorship support available."

Plus, for our beginner stream, we'll have mentors dedicated to individual teams, helping you build from start to finish."

    {
      "question": "What makes Hack404 unique?",
      "answer": "We created Hack404 around three key values: education, innovation, and community. To us, this means:\n\nEducation: Making the hackathon scene (and tech in general) more accessible to beginners. Getting started can be the hardest step, and we want to make that easier for first-time hackers.\n\nInnovation: We've seen that the tech scene is changing. New technologies, especially in the realm of AI, are constantly emerging, and we're encouraging our hackers to lean in to these technologies to make exciting new projects.\n\nCommunity: We want our hackers to think about the communities that they're a part of – what problems do they face, and how might our tech solutions help them? Think outside of just the developer community – let's make tech that benefits everyone."
